    <h1>About Credit Card Fraud</h1>
    
    <b><p>Credit card fraud is a form of identity theft that involves the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card information for fraudulent purposes. It can occur through various methods, including:</p></b>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Stolen Cards: Theft of physical credit cards or card information through techniques like skimming.</li>
        <li>Online Transactions: Obtaining credit card information through phishing emails, fake websites, or intercepting data during online transactions.</li>
        <li>Data Breaches: Cybercriminals target businesses and financial institutions to steal large databases of credit card information.</li>
        <li>Card-Not-Present Transactions: Fraud can occur in transactions where the physical card is not required, such as online purchases or over-the-phone transactions.</li>
    </ul>

   <b><p>To combat credit card fraud, various detection and prevention measures are employed:</p></b>

    <ul>
        <li>Fraud Detection Systems: Advanced algorithms analyze transaction patterns to flag suspicious activity.</li>
        <li>Authentication Methods: Two-factor authentication, biometric verification, and tokenization ensure only authorized users can access credit card information.</li>
        <li>Encryption: Secure transmission of data using encryption methods to protect credit card information.</li>
        <li>EMV Chip Cards: Chip cards provide stronger security compared to magnetic stripe cards by generating unique transaction codes.</li>
        <li>Customer Education: Educating consumers about phishing scams and secure online practices helps prevent fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <b><p>Credit card fraud prevention is an ongoing effort that requires collaboration between financial institutions, merchants, and consumers to stay vigilant against evolving fraud tactics.</p></b>
